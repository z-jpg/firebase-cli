AI Overview
The Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) provides tools for managing and deploying Firebase projects from the command line. 
Installation and Authentication:
Install npm: The Firebase CLI requires Node.js and npm. Ensure npm is installed on your system.
Install Firebase CLI: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
Code

    npm install -g firebase-tools
This command installs the Firebase CLI globally, making the firebase command accessible.
Verify Installation: Check the installed version:
Code

    firebase --version
Ensure the version is v4.1.0 or later.
Authenticate: Log in to your Google account to connect your local machine to Firebase:
Code

    firebase login
If you encounter issues with the default localhost authentication, use the --no-localhost flag:
Code

    firebase login --no-localhost
This will provide a URL to open in your browser for authentication and a code to paste back into the terminal.
Common Commands:
firebase init: Initializes a new Firebase project in the current directory, setting up configuration files and prompting for desired Firebase features (e.g., Hosting, Cloud Functions, Firestore).
firebase deploy: Deploys your project's code and configurations to Firebase, including Hosting content, Cloud Functions, and security rules.
firebase emulators:start: Starts the Firebase Local Emulator Suite, allowing you to test your application locally without deploying to Firebase.
firebase projects:list: Lists all Firebase projects associated with your authenticated account.
firebase functions:log: Displays logs for your Cloud Functions.
firebase data:get <path>: Fetches data from your Firebase Realtime Database at a specified path.
firebase firestore:delete <path> --recursive: Deletes data from your Cloud Firestore at a specified path, including subcollections if --recursive is used.
Using Gemini in Firebase CLI (if available):
firebase experimental:mcp:
Runs an MCP server for AI assistants like Gemini in Firebase Studio to interact with Firebase resources.
firebase studio:chat:
Allows direct interaction with Gemini in Firebase through the CLI for code suggestions, explanations, and more. 
Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI)
-------------------------------------

The following content describes how to install and use the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage, test, and deploy your Firebase projectsâ€”using the command line. You can use the Firebase CLI to accomplish any of the following tasks:

* To deploy code and assets to your Firebase projects
* To run a local web server for your Firebase Hosting site
* To interact with data in your Firebase database
* To import/Export users into/from Firebase Auth

To get started with the Firebase CLI, you can read the full list of commands below or at [hosting-specific CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).

## Installation

Before you can install the CLI, you need to install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) first, which typically comes with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

After npm is installed on your local machine, you can now get the Firebase CLI by following these steps:

1. Open terminal shell and run the following npm command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
    **Note**: This will provide you with the globally accessible `firebase` command.
    
2. Verify that the Firebase CLI has been installed correctly on your local machine by running the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase --version
    ```
    Make sure that the version of the Firebase CLI is v4.1.0 or later.

3. After installing the CLI, you must authenticate. you can sign into Firebase using your Google account by running the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
    This command connects your local machine to Firebase and grants you access to your Firebase projects.

## Commands

**The command `firebase --help` lists the available commands and `firebase <command> --help` shows more details for an individual command.**

If a command is project-specific, you must either be inside a project directory with an
active project alias or specify the Firebase project id with the `-P <project_id>` flag.

Below is a brief list of the available commands and their function:

### Administrative Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**login** | Authenticate to your Firebase account. Requires access to a web browser.
**logout** | Sign out of the Firebase CLI.
**login:ci** | Generate an authentication token for use in non-interactive environments.
**projects:list** | Print a list of all of your Firebase projects.
**setup:web** | Print out SDK setup information for the Firebase JS SDK.
**use** | Set active Firebase project, manage project aliases.
**open** | Quickly open a browser to relevant project resources.
**init** | Setup a new Firebase project in the current directory. This command will create a `firebase.json` configuration file in your current directory.
**help** | Display help information about the CLI or specific commands.

Append `--no-localhost` to login (i.e., `firebase login --no-localhost`) to copy and paste code instead of starting a local server for authentication. A use case might be if you SSH into an instance somewhere and you need to authenticate to Firebase on that machine.

### Deployment and Local Development

These commands let you deploy and interact with your Firebase services.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**deploy** | Deploys your Firebase project. Relies on `firebase.json` configuration and your local project folder.

### Auth Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**auth:import** | Batch importing accounts into Firebase from data file.
**auth:export** | Batch exporting accounts from Firebase into data file.

Detailed doc is [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/auth).

### Database Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**database:get** | Fetch data from the current project's database and display it as JSON. Supports querying on indexed data.
**database:set** | Replace all data at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:push** | Push new data to a list at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:remove** | Delete all data at a specified location in the current project's database.

**firestore:delete** | Delete documents or collections from the current project's database. Supports recursive deletion of subcollections.
**firestore:indexes** | List all deployed indexes from the current project.

### Cloud Functions Commands
AI Overview
Deploying Firebase Cloud Functions involves several steps using the Firebase CLI.
Prerequisites:
Firebase Project: A Firebase project needs to be set up in the Firebase Console.
Blaze Plan: The Firebase project must be on the Blaze plan, which enables billing for Cloud Functions, even though a free tier exists for limited usage.
Firebase CLI: The Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) needs to be installed and authenticated to your Firebase project.
Deployment Steps:
Initialize Cloud Functions:
If the project is new or functions are being added for the first time, initialize Cloud Functions within the project directory using firebase init functions. This sets up the necessary functions/ directory with boilerplate code and configuration files.
Write Functions:
Develop the Cloud Functions in JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python within the functions/ directory. These functions define the backend logic that will be triggered by various events or HTTPS requests.
Test Locally (Optional but Recommended):
Before deploying, functions can be tested locally using the Firebase Emulator Suite. Navigate to the functions/ directory and run npm run serve (for Node.js/TypeScript) or similar commands for Python to test the functions in a local environment.
Deploy Functions:
Once satisfied with the functions, deploy them to Firebase by navigating to the root of the Firebase project and running the command:
Code

    firebase deploy --only functions
This command compiles the code, uploads it to Google Cloud infrastructure, and makes the functions accessible.
Verify Deployment: After deployment, the Firebase CLI will provide URLs for any deployed HTTP-triggered functions. These can be accessed to verify the deployment. Cloud Functions can also be monitored in the Firebase Console under the "Functions" section.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**functions:log** | Read logs from deployed Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:set** | Store runtime configuration values for the current project's Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:get** | Retrieve existing configuration values for the current project's Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:unset** | Remove values from the current project's runtime configuration.
**functions:config:clone** | Copy runtime configuration from one project environment to another.
**functions:delete** | Delete one or more Cloud Functions by name or group name.
**functions:shell** | Locally emulate functions and start Node.js shell where these local functions can be invoked with test data.

### Hosting Commands

AI Overview
The Firebase CLI provides a set of commands specifically for managing Firebase Hosting. These commands allow for deployment, channel management, and local testing.
Deployment Commands:
```bash.
firebase deploy --only hosting
Code

    Deploys the Hosting content and configuration to the live channel of all Hosting sites configured in `firebase.json`.

*   ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting:TARGET_NAME
Deploys the Hosting content and configuration to the live channel of a specific Hosting site identified by TARGET_NAME.
Preview Channel Commands:
```bash.
firebase hosting:channel:deploy CHANNEL_ID
Code

    Deploys your Hosting content and configuration to the specified preview channel. If the channel does not exist, it is created in the default Hosting site before deployment.

*   ```bash
    firebase hosting:channel:deploy CHANNEL_ID --only TARGET_NAME
Deploys the Hosting content and configuration of a specific Hosting site to a preview channel. ```bash.
firebase hosting:channel:list
Code

    Lists all channels (including the "live" channel) in the default Hosting site.

*   ```bash
    firebase hosting:channel:open CHANNEL_ID
Opens a browser to the specified channel's URL or returns the URL if opening in a browser is not possible. ```bash.
firebase hosting:channel:delete CHANNEL_ID
Code

    Deletes the specified preview channel. The live channel of a site cannot be deleted.

**Local Development Command:**

*   ```bash
    firebase serve
Starts a local server with your Firebase Hosting configuration and HTTPS-triggered Cloud Functions, relying on your firebase.json file.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**hosting:disable** | Stop serving Firebase Hosting traffic for the active project. A "Site Not Found" message will be displayed at your project's Hosting URL after running this command.

## Using with CI Systems

The Firebase CLI requires a browser to complete authentication, but is fully
compatible with CI and other headless environments.

1. On a machine with a browser, install the Firebase CLI.
2. Run `firebase login:ci` to log in and print out a new [refresh token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
   (the current CLI session will not be affected).
3. Store the output token in a secure but accessible way in your CI system.

There are two ways to use this token when running Firebase commands:

1. Store the token as the environment variable `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and it will
   automatically be utilized.
2. Run all commands with the `--token <token>` flag in your CI system.

The order of precedence for token loading is flag, environment variable, active project.

On any machine with the Firebase CLI, running `firebase logout --token <token>`
will immediately revoke access for the specified token.

## Using as a Module

The Firebase CLI can also be used programmatically as a standard Node module. Each command is exposed as a function that takes an options object and returns a Promise. For example:

```js
var client = require('firebase-tools');
client.list().then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});

client.deploy({
  project: 'myfirebase',
  token: process.env.FIREBASE_TOKEN,
  force: true,
  cwd: '/path/to/project/folder'
}).then(function() {
  console.log('Rules have been deployed!')
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});
```
